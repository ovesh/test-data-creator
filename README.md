test-data-creator
=================

Create test data for your application, based on creation sqls or xml configuration

This application can be run as an SWT java app (it's horrible, but I wanted to experiment), or a commandline tool.

### TODO

- Add sample configuration files
- Add sample usage for CLI

### Dependencies

- sqlite3 (should be in your path)
- swt.jar for your platform
- sqlite jdbc ( https://bitbucket.org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc )
- log4j ( http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/ )
- MigLayout ( http://www.miglayout.com/ )
- JDOM 1.1.3 ( http://www.jdom.org/ )


To compile the PdfFile sample, you will need the iText PDF jar from http://itextpdf.com/itext.php
